<SMALL><P align=justify>The Old Babylonian Text Corpus und related matter here are encoded in Unicode (tm). 
Usually if you only like to find something in the text corpus, dictionary or in the sign lists, there is a keyboard, 
which will be displayed by your web browser and it will enable the input of special characters in the Unicode format. 
<p align=justify>If you like to join us and add some OB textual material to the corpus, then you will 
need a permanent possibility to write and input unicode characters. 
We have a very good experience with the <A HREF="http://www.unipad.org" TARGET=_blank>SC Unipad editor</A>. 
Using this editor any special characters used for transliteration of Old Babylonian and Sumerian could be 
easily entered.<br> 
You can get a free keyboard for use in SC Unipad editor, just ask us or prepare your own one according to your conventions. 
If you have a Unix X-System there is a usefull text editor called <A HREF="http://www.yudit.org/" TARGET=_blank>Yudit</A>.</p>
